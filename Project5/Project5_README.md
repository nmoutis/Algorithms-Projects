This project uses depth-first and breadth-first searches to traverse a maze represented by a boost graph object. The program uses the boost graph library version 1.57.0. The functions FindPathDFSRecursive and FindPthDFSStack are recursion based and stack based implementations of a depth-first search through the maze. The functions FindSHortestPathDFS and FindShortestPathBFS implement depth-first and breadth-first searches to find paths through the maze. The main function prompts the user to input the name of a maze file (maze_X.txt files are included in this project folder for this reason) and then prints the maze and the list of coordinates representing the path resulting from whichever function is run on that maze.
