This project is designed to emulate the card game "Set"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)). The main function calls the function PlaySet which initializes and shuffles a deck, deals 12 cards, and prints out all sets that the dealt cards contain. Then the program runs through several hands of cards of increasing number and prints the largest card group found with no sets(the largest possible hand with no sets is actually 20).
