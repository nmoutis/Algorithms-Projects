This project uses Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree of a graph. The program uses the boost graph library version 1.57.0. The main function first generates a graph object from one of the graph_x.txt files included in the files for this project. The graph is printed, and the functions FindSpanningForest and MSTPrim find spanning forrests and minimum spanning trees of the graph, and print these results.
